                Welcome to my portfolio! I have been learning computer science and coding for over a year, this skill has become a great obsession for me. 
                I went through a 24-week full stack coding bootcamp, and before that, I spent time learning the basics of Python, C, and JS.
                My greatest interest is in back-end web development, but I have practiced front-end as well.
